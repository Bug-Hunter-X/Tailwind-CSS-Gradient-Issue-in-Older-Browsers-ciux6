```javascript
// ... other Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

This code snippet uses Tailwind's gradient feature, however, it might unexpectedly fail when using older browser that don't support the `conic-gradient` function used internally by Tailwind for these gradients.  This leads to the gradient not rendering correctly or rendering a fallback color.
